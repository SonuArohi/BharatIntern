üö¢ Titanic Survival Classification Bharat Intern Project 



Objective: The objective of this project was to build a classification system that predicts whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic. Additionally, I aimed to analyze the factors that were most likely to lead to survival, such as socio-economic status, age, and gender.



Key Steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: I loaded the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and performed preprocessing steps. This involved removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features.



2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection and Engineering: I analyzed the dataset and selected relevant features like socio-economic status, age, and gender. I also engineered new features based on domain knowledge and dataset insights.



3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection and Training: I chose a Random Forest Classifier as the classification model. The data was split into training and testing sets, and the model was trained on the training set using the fit method.



4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation: I made predictions on the testing set using the trained model and evaluated its performance using accuracy and other evaluation metrics. The confusion matrix helped analyze the model's predictions.



5Ô∏è‚É£ Interpretation of Results: I analyzed the feature importances provided by the model to identify the factors most likely to lead to survival. This provided valuable insights into the relative importance of each feature.



The project's findings shed light on the factors that played a significant role in survival during the Titanic disaster. This analysis can contribute to a better understanding of historical events and human behavior in critical situations.
